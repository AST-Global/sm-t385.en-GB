## Battery charging tips and precautions

- When the battery power is low, the battery icon appears empty.
- If the battery is completely discharged, the device cannot be turned on immediately when the charger is connected. Allow a depleted battery to charge for a few minutes before turning on the device.
- If you use multiple apps at once, network apps, or apps that need a connection to another device, the battery will drain quickly. To avoid losing power during a data transfer, always use these apps after fully charging the battery. 
- Using a power source other than the charger, such as a computer, may result in a slower charging speed due to a lower electric current.
- The device can be used while it is charging, but it may take longer to fully charge the battery.
- If the device receives an unstable power supply while charging, the touchscreen may not function. If this happens, unplug the charger from the device.
- While charging, the device and the charger may heat up. This is normal and should not affect the deviceâ€™s lifespan or performance. If the battery gets hotter than usual, the charger may stop charging.
- If you charge the device while the multipurpose jack is wet, the device may be damaged. Thoroughly dry the multipurpose jack before charging the device.
- If the device is not charging properly, take the device and the charger to a Samsung Service Centre.
